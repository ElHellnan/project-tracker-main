## Environment Setup

### Required Tools
- Node.js (v18+)
- PostgreSQL (v15+)
- Git
- npm

### Environment Variables
```env
# Database
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/project_tracker"

# Authentication
JWT_SECRET="your-secret-key-here"
JWT_EXPIRES_IN="7d"

# Server Configuration
PORT=3001
NODE_ENV="development"

# Client Configuration
REACT_APP_API_URL="http://localhost:3001"

# Redis (for caching)
REDIS_URL="redis://localhost:6379"
```

### Development Setup
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install` in both client/ and server/
3. Set up environment variables
4. Initialize database: `npm run db:migrate`
5. Seed database: `npm run db:seed`
6. Start development: `npm run dev:full`

## Security Considerations

### Authentication & Authorization
- JWT-based authentication with secure token storage
- Password hashing using bcrypt with salt rounds
- Role-based access control (Owner, Member, Viewer)
- Session management with secure cookies

### Data Protection
- Input validation and sanitization on all endpoints
- SQL injection prevention through Prisma ORM
- XSS protection with proper output encoding
- CORS configuration for frontend-backend communication

### API Security
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Request size limits for file uploads
- HTTPS enforcement in production
- Secure headers (HSTS, CSP, etc.)

## Performance Requirements

### Response Times
- API responses: <500ms for standard operations
- Page load times: <2 seconds for initial load
- Database queries: <100ms for typical operations

### Scalability
- Expected concurrent users: 50-100
- Expected data growth: 10,000 tasks per month
- Caching strategy: Redis for session data and frequent queries

## Testing Strategy
